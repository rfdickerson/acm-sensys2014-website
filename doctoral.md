title: SenSys Doctoral Colloquium
permalink: /dc/
---


The Doctoral Colloquium (DC) of SenSys'14 is to provide a friendly, supportive, and constructive environment where PhD students can present their research-in-progress for an open discussion guided by a panel of experienced researchers and practitioners. Applicants should be far enough into their PhD to have a concrete proposal, and have initially outlined the salient issues and proposed research methodology. Applicants should not be planning to submit their PhD thesis or dissertation for at least four months after the DC, so that any advice or input may still be incorporated into the doctoral work.

The DC will be a half-day, seminar-style event, consisting of short presentations followed by roundtable discussion. Time will be allotted to each student not only for the presentation, but also for careful, in-depth consideration and discussion amongst the panelists and DC participants.

In addition to the DC presentation, the participants will be given a chance to present a poster at the poster session during the main conference.

### SUBMISSIONS ###
Topic scope is the same as that listed in the SenSys call for papers. DC submissions should consist of a single PDF document using the SenSys paper template. The document should contain the following:

Research summary (3 pages) describing the work in progress and including a 100-word abstract. Things to consider for inclusion in the research summary might be: the expected contribution to the field of sensor networking; the original idea or thesis statement; the problem domain and the specific problem addressed; a brief overview of related work; the methodological approach; research carried out and results so far.

Student biographical sketch, including the names and affiliations of the research advisor(s), and expected date of dissertation submission.

The submission site is: [http://submit.ece.cmu.edu/sensysDC/](http://submit.ece.cmu.edu/sensysDC/)

Research summaries will be reviewed by the chairs and panel members. If the work is accepted, a student may be expected to make clarifications and improvements to the research summary by the camera-ready deadline. Note that the research summaries will not be formally published, but hardcopies will be made available to colloquium delegates.

A prize for best student presentation will be awarded by the panel.


### REGISTRATION ###
Accepted participants of the doctoral colloquium shall register with the SenSys workshop registration rate (if applicable at the student rate). The registration is free if the student also attends and has registered for the SenSys conference. Participants can also apply for SenSys travel grants.
