title: SenSys Doctoral Colloquium
permalink: /dc/
---

The Doctoral Colloquium (DC) of SenSys 2014 seeks to provide a
friendly, supportive, and constructive environment where PhD students
can present their research in progress for an open discussion guided
by a panel of experienced researchers and practitioners.

The DC will be structured as a series of short presentations by the
students followed by individual discussions, feedback, and advise. The
student presentations will be interleaved with speeches by leading
researchers, who will provide their own perspectives on current and
future research trends in networked sensing, as well as on how to best
purse a Ph.D. in this field. Participating students will also have the
opportunity to present a poster during the main conference to leverage
further interaction with SenSys attendees.

Current Ph.D. students in the early stages of their career are
encouraged to submit a 2-page extended abstract about their
dissertation research to be considered for the DC. The abstract shall
also include a one-paragraph bio of the student, along with
information on how long he/she has been in Ph.D. school and the
expected time until graduation. The student should be the sole author,
although contributions of the advisor and others should be
acknowledged. The DC committee will review submissions to ensure
quality, relevance, and potential benefit from attendance. Authors of
accepted submissions are expected to participate in person to the DC -
to be held on November 6th, 2014 - and to present a poster at the main
conference. There will be no separate registration fee for the DC.
