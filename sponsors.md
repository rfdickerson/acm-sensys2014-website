####Become a supporter####

SenSys welcomes financial support from companies and organizations. Supporting
SenSys is a great opportunity to increase visibility and product awareness
within networked sensing system communities.

Supporters will be acknowledged at the conference opening remark. Company names
and logos will appear on SenSys 2014 website and proceedings. In addition, each
supporter will receive a table at the demo/poster session, if they wish, to
showcase their product to the sensor system research community. The minimum
support is $1,000. Every $5,000 support will receive one free conference
registration.

Supporters may direct their fund to specific SenSys 2012 awards or events, such
as Best Paper Award(s), Best Demo Award(s), Best Poster Award(s), Student Travel
Award(s), N2Women, and conference reception. Other demands can be discussed on a
case-by-case basis.
